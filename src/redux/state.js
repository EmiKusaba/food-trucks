The Food truck is new, and they are still working on the ambiance with decorations and lighting.   And occasionally if they are extremely slammed, can get overwhelmed.  But this is all forgivable because I've never waited more than 10 minutes for a food, and everyone is very hospitable."

You can go and stand in lines at many other places and at times here too but Micklethwait, has never let me down with the quality of their food. I've eaten here for over 5 years and still come at least once a month. Their smoked barbacoa is perfect."
